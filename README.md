Persistence:
	Persistence is “the continuance of an effect after its cause is removed”. In the context of storing data in a computer system, this means that the data survives after the process with which it was created has ended. In other words, for a data store to be considered persistent, it must write to non-volatile storage.

Session persistence:
	Session persistence refers to directing a client’s requests to the same back-end web or application server for the duration of a “session” or the time it takes to complete a task or transaction.

	If a user browses your website for five minutes, she probably fetches information from multiple back-end servers. Not accessing the same server every time can cause problems if the web browser or back-end server tries to improve the web experience by storing information that enables the user’s next action to occur more quickly. In this case, it is important – not to say imperative – that all of the user’s requests are sent to the same server.
